allowed.<br><br><strong>Character Creation and Backstory:</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create well-developed characters with detailed backstories that align with the server's lore and theme.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure your character's story contributes to the immersive roleplay environment.<br><br><strong>Value Life:</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prioritize the

Chat:</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use appropriate voice chat for in-character (IC) communication and reserve the out-of-character (OOC) chat for non-roleplay
